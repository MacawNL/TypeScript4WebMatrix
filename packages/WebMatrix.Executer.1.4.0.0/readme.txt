Dear user,

Thanks for installing the WebMatrix.Executer NuGet package.

The WebMatrix Extensibility Model does not support out of the box the executing
of applications and scripts, an output pane, and an Error List pane that may 
be used by WebMatrix Extension Writers. Although there is an Error List pane 
available, this pane may not be used by custom extensions.

WebMatrix.Executer provides a library that can be included in your own baked
WebMatrix extension to execute applications and PowerShell scripts, send 
the output in realtime to a WebMatrix Output pane, and parse the output for 
errors and warnings that are displayed in a WebMatrix Errors & Warnings pane
with just a few lines of code. Multiple extensions using WebMatrix.Executer
will use the same panes.

See the website http://macawnl.github.com/WebMatrix.Executer/ for documentation
and links to the source code (GitHub).

Happy Execution!

Serge van den Oever [Macaw]
