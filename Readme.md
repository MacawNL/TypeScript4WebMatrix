# TypeScript4WebMatrix

## Introduction

TypeScript is a new language for application-scale Javascript development. TypeScript is designed by Anders Hejlsberg, inventor of C#.

Although there is great support for TypeScript in Visual Studio through an installable [MSI](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=266563), we also need support for TypeScript in WebMatrix.

The TypeScript4WebMatrix extension provides compilation support for TypeScript within WebMatrix. This package provides the following functionality:

* Compile all TypeScript files in the workspace
* Compile all TypeScript files in a folder
* Compile a TypeScript file
